# SpreeWholesaleStorefront

A simple wholesale solution for Spree Commerce. Spree Wholesale Storefront adds wholesale pricing to products and wholesaler accounts to users in the backend, and Storefront V2 API routes.

Inspired by the work here [https://github.com/patrickmcelwee/spree_wholesale](https://github.com/patrickmcelwee/spree_wholesale)

  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rspec spec/
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_wholesale_storefront/factories'
```

## To Do

* Write integration/feature tests for backend
* Better admin routing logic styling
